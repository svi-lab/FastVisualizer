# Instructions:
### "Installation" (you just have to do it once)
After downloading (and unzipping) the files, open a terminal in that directory (anaconda prompt, git-bash, cmd, or whatever)
and type `conda env create -f environment.yml` to create the new environment and install the necessary python modules in it.

### Running the script:
Open a terminal in the directory containing the downloaded files, and type:
`conda activate raman_svi`
to activate the environment
then just run the script by typing:
`python ShowSelected.py`
